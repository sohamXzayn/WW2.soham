                <b>World War II</b>, conflict that involved virtually every part of the
                 world during the years <b>1939–45</b>. The principal belligerents were the 
                 Axis powers—<i>Germany</i>,<i> Italy</i>, and<i> Japan</i>—and 
                 the Allies—<i>France</i>,<i> Great 
                 Britain</i>, <i>the United States</i>, <i>the Soviet Union</i>, and, to a lesser
                  extent, <i>China</i>. The war was in many respects a continuation, 
                  after an uneasy <b>20</b>-year 
                hiatus, of the disputes left unsettled by <b>World War I</b>. 
                The <b>40,000,000–50,000,000</b> deaths incurred in <b>World War II</b>
                 make it the bloodiest conflict, as well as the largest war, 
                 in history.

    Along with <b>World War I</b>, <b>World War II</b> was one of the great 
    watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. It resulted in 
    the extension of the <i>Soviet Union’s</i> power to nations
     of <i>eastern Europe</i>, enabled a communist movement to
      eventually achieve power in <i>China</i>, and marked the 
      decisive shift of power in the world away from the states
       of <i>western Europe</i> and toward 
       the <i>United States</i> and <i>the Soviet Union</i>.

        <p class="para">By the early part of <b>1939</b> the
             <i>German</i> dictator <u>Adolf Hitler</u> had become determined 
             to invade and occupy <i>Poland. Poland</i>, for its part, had guarantees
              of <i>French</i> and <i>British</i> military support should it be 
              attacked by <i>Germany</i>. <u>Hitler</u> intended to
               invade <i>Poland</i>anyway,
               but first he had to neutralize the possibility that
                <i>the Soviet Union</i> would resist the invasion of its western 
                neighbour. Secret negotiations led on <b>August 23–24</b> to the 
                signing of the <i>German-Soviet</i> Nonaggression Pact in <i>Moscow</i>.
                 In a 
                secret protocol of this pact, the <i>Germans</i> and the <i>Soviets</i> agreed 
                that <i>Poland</i> should be divided between them, with the western third 
                of the country going to <i>Germany</i> and the 
            eastern two-thirds being taken over by the <i>U.S.S.R</i>.

            <p class="para">
            Having achieved this cynical agreement, 
            the other provisions of which stupefied <i>Europe</i> 
            even without divulgence of the secret protocol, <u>Hitler</u> 
            thought that <i>Germany</i> could attack <i>Poland</i> with no danger 
            of <i>Soviet</i> or <i>British</i> intervention and gave 
            orders for the 
            invasion to start on <b>August 26</b>. News of the signing,
             on <b>August 25</b>, of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between 
             <i>Great Britain</i> and <i>Poland</i> (to supersede a
              previous though 
             temporary agreement) caused him to postpone the start of 
             hostilities for a few days. He was still determined, however, 
             to ignore the diplomatic efforts of the western powers to 
             restrain him. Finally, at <b>12:40 pm</b> on <b>August 31, 1939</b>, <u>Hitler</u> 
             ordered hostilities against <i>Poland</i> to start at <b>4:45</b> the next 
             morning. The invasion began as ordered. In response, <i>Great Britain</i> 
             and <i>France</i> declared war on <i>Germany</i> on <b>September 3</b>, at <b>11:00 am</b> 
             and at <b>5:00 pm</b>, respectively. <b>World War II</b> had begun.

            <p class="para" id="paraone">In September 1939 the Allies,
                 namely Great Britain, France, and Poland, 
                 were together superior in industrial resources, 
                 population, and military manpower, but the German military, 
                 or Wehrmacht, because of its armament, training, doctrine, 
                 discipline, and fighting spirit, was the most efficient and effective 
                 fighting force for its size in the world. The index of military strength in
                  September 1939 was the number of divisions that each 
                  nation could mobilize. Against Germany’s 100 infantry 
                  divisions and six armoured divisions, France had 90 infantry 
                  divisions in metropolitan France, Great Britain had 10 infantry 
                  divisions, and Poland had 30 infantry divisions, 12 cavalry brigades, 
                  and one armoured brigade (Poland had also 30 reserve infantry divisions, 
                  but these could not be mobilized quickly). 
                A division contained from 12,000 to 25,000 men.</p>

        <p class="para">It was the qualitative superiority of the 
            German infantry divisions and the number of their armoured 
            divisions that made the difference in 1939. The firepower of a 
            German infantry division far exceeded that of a French, British, 
            or Polish division; the standard German division included 442 machine 
            guns, 135 mortars, 72 antitank guns, and 24 howitzers. Allied divisions 
            had a firepower only slightly greater than that of World War I. Germany 
            had six armoured divisions in September 1939; the Allies, though they had a 
            large number 
            of tanks, had no armoured divisions at that time.
        </p>

        <p class="para">The six armoured, or panzer, 
            divisions of the Wehrmacht comprised some 2,400 tanks. 
            And though Germany would subsequently expand its tank forces during 
            the first years of the war, it was not the number of tanks that Germany 
            had (the Allies had almost as many in September 1939) but the fact of 
            their being organized into divisions and operated as such that was to 
            prove decisive. In accordance with the doctrines of General Heinz Guderian, 
            the German tanks were used in massed formations in conjunction with motorized 
            artillery to punch holes in the enemy line and to isolate segments of the 
            enemy, which were then surrounded and captured by motorized German infantry 
            divisions while the tanks ranged forward to repeat the process: deep drives 
            into enemy territory by panzer divisions were thus followed by mechanized 
            infantry and foot soldiers. These tactics were supported by dive bombers 
            that attacked and disrupted the enemy’s supply and communications lines and 
            spread panic and confusion in its rear, thus further paralyzing its defensive
             capabilities. Mechanization was the key to the German blitzkrieg, or 
             “lightning war,” so named because of the unprecedented speed and mobility 
             that were its salient characteristics. Tested and well-trained in maneuvers, 
             the German panzer divisions 
            constituted a force with no equal in Europe.

            The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, was also the 
            best force of its kind in 1939. It was a ground-cooperation force 
            designed to support the Army, but its planes were superior to nearly 
            all Allied types. In the rearmament period from 1935 to 1939 the production 
            of German combat aircraft steadily mounted.

            The standardization of engines and airframes gave the 
            Luftwaffe an advantage over its opponents. Germany had an 
            operational force of 1,000 fighters and 1,050 bombers in September 
            1939. The Allies actually had more planes in 1939 than Germany did, 
            but their strength was made up of many different types, some of them 
            obsolescent. The corresponding table shows the number of first-line military 
            aircraft 
            available to the Allies at the outbreak of war.

            Great Britain, which was held back by delays in the 
            rearmament program, was producing one modern fighter in 1939, 
            the Hurricane. A higher-performance fighter, the Spitfire, was just 
            coming into production and 
            did not enter the air war in numbers until 1940.The value of the
             French Air Force in 1939 was reduced by the number of obsolescent 
             planes in its order of battle: 131 of the 634 fighters and nearly all 
             of the 463 bombers. France was desperately trying to buy 
            high-performance aircraft in the United States in 1939.
