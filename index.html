                <b>World War II</b>, conflict that involved virtually every part of the
                 world during the years <b>1939–45</b>. The principal belligerents were the 
                 Axis powers—<i>Germany</i>,<i> Italy</i>, and<i> Japan</i>—and 
                 the Allies—<i>France</i>,<i> Great 
                 Britain</i>, <i>the United States</i>, <i>the Soviet Union</i>, and, to a lesser
                  extent, <i>China</i>. The war was in many respects a continuation, 
                  after an uneasy <b>20</b>-year 
                hiatus, of the disputes left unsettled by <b>World War I</b>. 
                The <b>40,000,000–50,000,000</b> deaths incurred in <b>World War II</b>
                 make it the bloodiest conflict, as well as the largest war, 
                 in history.

    Along with <b>World War I</b>, <b>World War II</b> was one of the great 
    watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. It resulted in 
    the extension of the <i>Soviet Union’s</i> power to nations
     of <i>eastern Europe</i>, enabled a communist movement to
      eventually achieve power in <i>China</i>, and marked the 
      decisive shift of power in the world away from the states
       of <i>western Europe</i> and toward 
       the <i>United States</i> and <i>the Soviet Union</i>.

            <b id="bold">The outbreak of war</b>

        <p class="para">By the early part of <b>1939</b> the
             <i>German</i> dictator <u>Adolf Hitler</u> had become determined 
             to invade and occupy <i>Poland. Poland</i>, for its part, had guarantees
              of <i>French</i> and <i>British</i> military support should it be 
              attacked by <i>Germany</i>. <u>Hitler</u> intended to
               invade <i>Poland</i>anyway,
               but first he had to neutralize the possibility that
                <i>the Soviet Union</i> would resist the invasion of its western 
                neighbour. Secret negotiations led on <b>August 23–24</b> to the 
                signing of the <i>German-Soviet</i> Nonaggression Pact in <i>Moscow</i>.
                 In a 
                secret protocol of this pact, the <i>Germans</i> and the <i>Soviets</i> agreed 
                that <i>Poland</i> should be divided between them, with the western third 
                of the country going to <i>Germany</i> and the 
            eastern two-thirds being taken over by the <i>U.S.S.R</i>.

            <p class="para">
            Having achieved this cynical agreement, 
            the other provisions of which stupefied <i>Europe</i> 
            even without divulgence of the secret protocol, <u>Hitler</u> 
            thought that <i>Germany</i> could attack <i>Poland</i> with no danger 
            of <i>Soviet</i> or <i>British</i> intervention and gave 
            orders for the 
            invasion to start on <b>August 26</b>. News of the signing,
             on <b>August 25</b>, of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between 
             <i>Great Britain</i> and <i>Poland</i> (to supersede a
              previous though 
             temporary agreement) caused him to postpone the start of 
             hostilities for a few days. He was still determined, however, 
             to ignore the diplomatic efforts of the western powers to 
             restrain him. Finally, at <b>12:40 pm</b> on <b>August 31, 1939</b>, <u>Hitler</u> 
             ordered hostilities against <i>Poland</i> to start at <b>4:45</b> the next 
             morning. The invasion began as ordered. In response, <i>Great Britain</i> 
             and <i>France</i> declared war on <i>Germany</i> on <b>September 3</b>, at <b>11:00 am</b> 
             and at <b>5:00 pm</b>, respectively. <b>World War II</b> had begun.
